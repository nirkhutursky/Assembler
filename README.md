# Assembler

## 🛠 Overview
This project is an assembler written in C for a custom computer architecture. It translates assembly code into machine code, handling macros, labels, and various addressing modes. The assembler processes input files, parses macros, and generates binary code, following a two-pass method.

## ✨ Features
- **Macro Processing**: Supports macro definitions and usage within the assembly code.
- **Two-Pass Assembly**: 
  - **Pass One**: Builds a symbol table and handles labels.
  - **Pass Two**: Translates instructions and generates machine code.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and reports syntax errors and memory allocation issues.
- **Memory Management**: Properly allocates and frees memory to avoid leaks, as verified using Valgrind.
- **Support for Custom Architecture**: Implements a specific instruction set and addressing modes, including immediate, direct, indirect register, and direct register addressing.

## 🚀 Installation
To build and run the assembler, you need a GCC compiler and Make utility installed on your system.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirkhutursky/Assembler.git
cd Assembler
```

### Build the project
```bash
make
```

### Run the assembler
```bash
./assembler <input_file>
```

## 💻 Usage
Provide the assembler with an assembly file as input. The assembler will generate corresponding machine code output files.

Example:
```bash
./assembler test1
```

## 📂 File Structure
- **`main.c`**: Main function to handle the input and manage the assembly process.
- **`MacroProcessing.c`**: Handles macro definitions and usage.
- **`passOne.c`**: First pass of the assembler, building the symbol table and processing labels.
- **`passTwo.c`**: Second pass of the assembler, translating instructions into machine code.
- **`helper.c`**: Utility functions used across the assembler.
- **`AssemblyConstants.c`**: Contains constants used in the assembly process.

## 🧪 Testing and Debugging
- **Valgrind**: Memory management and leak detection were verified using Valgrind. The assembler has been tested to ensure no memory leaks.
